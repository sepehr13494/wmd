Please note that not all tracking will stop even if you delete cookies.</7></6></5><5>We may collect your Personal Data from you directly.  We may also collect Personal Data from third parties including agents that give instructions on your behalf or any other governmental, quasi-governmental bodies that may provide Personal Data on your behalf.

We typically use third party e-mail service providers to send e-mails. These service providers are contractually prohibited from using your e-mail address for any purpose other than to send e-mails related to TFO’s operations. We provide you the ability to unsubscribe from all marketing communications, without any costs. Every time you receive an e-mail, you will be provided with the choice to opt-out of future e-mails by following the instructions provided in the e-mail. You may also opt-out of receiving promotional materials by contacting us.</7><7>Use justification: consent (which can be withdrawn at any time);</7><7>For analytics and profiling ► to tailor our marketing to you. In connection with our marketing activities, we analyze information that we collect about customers to determine what offers are most likely to be of interest to different categories of customers in different circumstances and at different times. We call this the creation of “segments”. Such Personal Data include customer behavioral information such as transaction history, preferences, service requests and interactions with us. From time to time, we will assess the Personal Data that we hold about you in order to assign you to a particular segment. We may use the segment that you have been assigned to you in order to tailor our marketing communications to include offers and content that are relevant to you. We may also use this method to avoid sending you offers that are inappropriate or unlikely to be of interest to you. You have the right to opt out of such analysis of your Personal Data that we use to tailor the direct marketing that we send to you, at any time.<1>Use justification: consent (which can be withdrawn at any time); legitimate interests (to enable us to tailor our marketing to you);</1></7><7>To comply with our legal and regulatory obligations ► to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations such as financial reporting requirements imposed by our auditors and government authorities, and to cooperate with law enforcement agencies, government authorities, regulators and/or the court in connection with proceedings or investigations anywhere in the world where we are compelled to do so (e.g. to comply with anti-money laundering, KYC obligations).<1>Use justification: legal obligation, legal claims, legitimate interests (to cooperate with law enforcement and regulatory authorities);</1></7><7>To handle incidents and process any claims we receive► to handle any accidents and incidents such as liaising with emergency services, and to handle any claims made by customers;<1>Use justification: vital interest, legal claims, legitimate interests (to ensure that incidents and accidents are handle appropriately and to allow us to assist our customers);</1></7><7>To improve our services and products ► to assist in developing new services and products and to improve our existing services and products.

These parties are contractually prohibited from using Personal Data for any purpose other than for the purpose specified in their respective contracts and will be subject to obligations to process Personal Data in compliance with the same safeguards that we deploy. We also provide non-personally identifiable information to these parties for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us. We do not permit the sale of Personal Data to entities outside of TFO for any use unrelated to our group operations or use of Personal Data by third party for their own purposes.</7><7>Law enforcement agencies, government authorities, regulators and the court in order to comply with our legal obligations or to handle incidents/ claims► We may disclose your Personal Data when required by relevant law or court order, or as requested by other government or law enforcement authorities, or any agency, court, regulator or other third party where we believe this is necessary to assist with proceedings or investigations. Where permitted, we will direct any such request to you or notify you before responding unless to do so would prejudice the prevention or detection of a crime. This also applies when we have reason to believe that disclosing the Personal Data is necessary to obtain legal advice, to identify, investigate, protect, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our guests, visitors, associates, rights or properties, or to others, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities.</7><7>Third parties who require such data in connection with a change in the structure of our business ► In the event that we (or a part thereof) are (i) subject to negotiations for the sale of our business or (ii) sold to, merge with, or sell substantially all of our assets to a third party or (iii) undergo a reorganization, you agree that any of your Personal Data which we hold may be transferred to that reorganized entity or third party and used for the same purposes as set out in this Privacy Policy, or for the purpose of analyzing any proposed sale or re-organization. We will ensure that no more of your Personal Data is transferred than necessary.</7></6></5><5>This Privacy Policy does not apply to our processing of personal information on behalf of, or at the direction of, third party providers who may collect personal information from you and provide it to us. In this situation, we would merely act as a data processor and thus advise you to review applicable third-party providers’ privacy policies before submitting your personal information.<1>Use justifications and legal grounds</1><1>We note the grounds we use to justify each use of your information next to the use in the How we use Personal Data and How we share Personal Data sections of this policy.</1><1>These are the principal legal grounds that justify our use of your Personal Data:</1><1>Consent: where you have consented to our use of your Personal Data</1><1>Contract performance: where your Personal Data is necessary to enter into or perform our contract with you.</1><1>Legal and regulatory obligation: where we need to use your Personal Data to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.</1><1>Legitimate interests: where we use your Personal Data to achieve a legitimate interest and our reasons for using it outweigh any prejudice to your data protection rights.</1><1>Legal claims: where your information is necessary for us to defend, prosecute or make a claim against you, us or a third party.</1><1>Vital interest: where we need to process your Personal Data to protect the vital interest of you or another natural person e.g. where you require urgent assistance</1></5></4></3><3><15>How we transmit, protect and store Personal Data</15><16>Security over the internet</16><4><5>It is important to note that all Internet communication is not secure. There is a risk inherent in the use of e-mail. Please be aware of this when requesting information or sending forms to us by e-mail, for example, from the “Contact Us” section. We recommend that you do not include any sensitive information when using e-mail or using any public computers/public WIFI. Our e-mail responses to you may not include any sensitive or confidential information. Please bear in mind that no security system or system of transmitting information over the Internet is guaranteed to be secure.</5><5>If your application is successful and a user account is set up, you should always close your browsers when you have finished completing a form. Although the session will automatically terminate after a short period of inactivity, it is easier for a third party to gain access to your profile whilst you are logged onto your account.</5><5>We treat all Personal Data that you provide to us as confidential information. To prevent Personal Data from unauthorized access or leakage, we have adopted and regularly monitor our security and data privacy policies and procedures. We use SSL protocol – an industry standard for encryption over the Internet, to protect the Data. When you type in sensitive information, it will be automatically encrypted and transferred over an SSL connection. This ensures that your sensitive Data is encrypted as it travels over the Internet. You will know that you are in a secure mode when the security icon (such as a lock) appears in the screen.<1><8>Security controls</8></1></5><5>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and for complying with any other security procedures that we notify you of. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</5><5>TFO trains its employees and staff on the importance of data privacy and protection. Our Privacy Policy is updated as required to reflect any changes in applicable laws and developments in best practice procedures. Further, we limit the number of individuals within the companies with access to Personal Data to those directly involved in the process of providing quality service to you.</5><5>We store certain customer information in our Customer Information System. Both systems are secure customer databases stored on a dedicated server located in a data center in Ireland hosted by a third-party service provider. Our server resides behind firewalls to protect Personal Data collected from you against unauthorized or accidental access. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements.<1>Data transmission across international borders</1></5><5>The nature of our business and our operations require us to transfer your Personal Data to other authorized distributors, centers of operations, data centers, or service providers that may be located in countries outside of your own for the purposes mentioned in this Privacy Policy. Although the data protection and other laws of these various countries may not be as comprehensive as those in your own country, TFO will take appropriate measures, including implementing up to date contractual clauses, to secure the transfer of your Data to recipients (which may be internal or external to TFO) located in a country with a level of protection different from the one existing in the country in which your Data is collected.</5><5>Where your Personal Data may be transferred to a country in which data protection laws may be of a lower standard than in the transferor country, TFO will impose the same data protection safeguards that we deploy in the countries in which we operate to ensure an adequate level of protection for this data.</5><5>The Personal Data collected using the means located in Bahrain may be required to be transferred outside Bahrain for processing. As there are no approved jurisdictions that provide adequate level of data protection required under Bahrain law, any transfer of Personal Data outside Bahrain requires your consent.
